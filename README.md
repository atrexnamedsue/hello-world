# hello-world
what to say here...

I am a journalist w/ special interests in neuroscience, health, environment, subcultures. Now tech :) 
I was a self-described 'right-brained' person, interested in the world of STEM but believing myself capable of only writing about it, until I realized that these limits were self/societally-imposed and that I could transcend them if I just tried a little harder (plus, as any person interested in the brain could tell you, the right-left construct is a myth). 
I'm wading through the muck now. Learning Python and hoping to get a full stack down by the end of the year. 
I want to write code so I can make beautiful, useful things. I want to write in new languages, and coding is the language of the present and future.
